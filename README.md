# dh2016

##### **TO DO**
1. Check out last year's winners

### **Questions**
1. Is there a 2-girls-in-team challenge this year as well? (possible hunger games with Naum & Blagica)

### **Ideas** *(from Alek's notes)*
1. Social media (fb/twitter/google+/linkedin) graph (ego network?) that is multiedge and multicolor. Approaches:
    - Community detection (work friends/play friends?)
    - Unique friends (e.g. only on twitter)

2. Recommendation systems for FRI subjects (e.g. MSc level) and taking into account their difficulty (questionnaires?). Approaches:
	- Matrix factorization
	- Data Fusion (Orange/Python)
		
3. (mediocre) Object recognition to identify instagram trends
